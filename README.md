# PrintQueueWatchCPP

This project is based on PrintQueueWatch (https://printqueuewatch.codeplex.com) made by Duncan Jones (http://www.merrioncomputing.com/)
for printer monitoring, it can log every print job in Windows printers.

The original project was written in VB.NET, but for compatibilty purposes, I needed something that don't relies on .NET Framework, so, I rewrote
the basic functionality in C++.

Compatible OS:
* Windows XP or later

Dependencies:
* POSIX Threads
* Windows API

Supported Compilers:
* GCC (but every windows C++ compiler should work)

How to use it:
TODO
